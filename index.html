                After so many different wiring prototypes this is what I ended up and figured out. However I couldn’t
                figure out the coding part, I kind of failed.

                The object I have chosen to redesign is the Calculator. When I’m working in the wood shop, I find myself
                using the calculator to calculate measurements. Regular calculators are big and hard to use because in
                Canada we still use the imperial (INCH) system and material (wood) is still sold in imperial.
                <br>
                <br>
                Woodworkers in the shop are using a app that calculates fractions making adding and subtracting
                fractions easier as they are presented in fractions and not in long decimals.
                <br>
                <br>
                The issue is I don’t like using my phone in my workspace because it is distracting and I don’t want to
                break it that’s why I want to make a Fractional Calculator for the woodworker in the physical form.

            For buttons I tried 4x4 button matrix but it was going to use so much pin in my board even not enough.
